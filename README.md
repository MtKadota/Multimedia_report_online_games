# Multimedia_report_online_games
report/code for Csc461

The main idea with this page is to document my findings and insites in multimedia with regards to multiplayer games.
This will consist of two parts this github page documenting things I've lerned and a secondary website hosting a simple multiplayer game I've created.

Please not a large portion of the code upto this point (11/1/2023) was created following an online corse from this channel https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses.
I plan to improve upon this code as well as implement a few feautures to better ilistrate different findings related to multimedia in relation to the code
